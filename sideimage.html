    <p class="io">Once you have the basic categories in place, then you must consider how you will present the sources themselves within the body of your paper. 
        Create an organizational method to focus this section even further
         To help you come up with an overall organizational framework for your review, consider the following scenario:
        You’ve decided to focus your literature review on materials dealing with sperm whales. 
        This is because you’ve just finished reading Moby Dick, and you wonder if that whale’s portrayal is really real. 
        You start with some articles about the physiology of sperm whales in biology journals written in the 1980’s. 
        But these articles refer to some British biological studies performed on whales in the early 18th century. So you check those out. 
        Then you look up a book written in 1968 with information on how sperm whales have been portrayed in other forms of art, such as in Alaskan poetry, in French painting, or on whale bone, as the whale hunters in the late 19th century used to do. 
        This makes you wonder about American whaling methods during the time portrayed in Moby Dick, so you find some academic articles published in the last five years on how accurately Herman Melville portrayed the whaling scene in his novel.
        Now consider some typical ways of organizing the sources into a review:
        Chronological: If your review follows the chronological method, you could write about the materials above according to when they were published. For instance, first you would talk about the British biological studies of the 18th century,
         then about Moby Dick, published in 1851, then the book on sperm whales in other art (1968).</p>
