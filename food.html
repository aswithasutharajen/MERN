   <center><p>After perfecting the recipes, nailing your food presentation,
     and choosing the right food truck name, you have to find the actual truck,
      outfit it with the right food truck equipment and hire a team to run it.
       All of this takes time. 
        Once your food truck is ready for business, you need to develop a strategy for attracting guests and generating repeat orders. 
        But how do you find and keep  customers. Marketing and branding.</p></center>
