    <p>CSS Media Queries are an essential tool for modern web development, allowing developers to 
        create responsive designs that adapt to the characteristics of the user’s device. 
        This powerful feature of CSS ensures that web pages are displayed optimally on various devices, whether they are desktop monitors, tablets, or smartphones. By applying specific styles based on screen width, height, orientation, resolution, and more, media queries help in delivering a seamless and user-friendly experience across all devices. This article will explore various methods and examples to effectively use CSS Media Queries to achieve responsive web design.
